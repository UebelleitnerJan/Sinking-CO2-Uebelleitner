This repository contains all the files used in the thesis "CO2 Storage in Supercritical Geothermal Systems" by Ãœbelleitner Jan.

The mesh files, well_in.bh and well_out.bh, as well as the CO2 files may need to be adjusted to create the described configurations of injection depth and permeability.

The Exodus output files of the results are located in "Results" and contain all of the cases described in the thesis.
